# Thesis scripts

Scripts for performing the analysis and generating the figures in my thesis.

Contains:
- Submodules: core code for modelling and image analysis
- Ipython notebooks: for running the analysis and generating figures
- Shell scripts: for running some of the model parameter sweeps on CAMP
- PNG files: individual image panels
- Illustrator files: one for each thesis figure

NB. Not intended to be directly run on anyone else's machine as you won't have access to the data and some of the links won't work, but may serve as a useful reference.
